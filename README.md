# Polynomial Regression In Python Using TensorFlow 2.0

This is my project to learn about polynomial regression, how optimizers/loss functions work etc. You can get more information about this project (such as the math behind MSE and SGD which are used in the code) at my blog post which you can go with [this](https://blog.tekno.icu/2020/01/22/polynomial-regression-in-python-using-tensorflow-2-0/) link.
